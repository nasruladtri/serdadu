feat: Implement dedicated compare page with side-by-side chart layout

- Add new /compare route and compare() method in PublicDashboardController
- Create compare.blade.php view with dual filter sections (Primary & Compare)
- Implement side-by-side chart layout (left: Primary, right: Compare) instead of combined chart
- Add tab navigation for all chart categories (always visible, not conditional)
- Fix semester dropdown to show all available semesters (including semester 1)
- Add semester validation based on selected year (only show semesters available for that year)
- Ensure chart labels and data match user-selected filters
- Add validation to prevent displaying data for invalid semester/year combinations
- Update sidebar navigation to use route names for compare page

Changes:
- Dropdown semester now prioritizes semesters available for selected year
- Chart rendering split into separate primary and compare charts
- Badge labels use actual user input instead of resolved periods
- Improved error handling for invalid period selections
